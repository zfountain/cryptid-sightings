# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# Cryptid.create(name: "Bigfoot", content: "Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is a big, hairy beast often spotted in the forest of the Pacific Northwest")

# Cryptid.create(name: "Chupacabras", content: "Chupacabras are small monsters who suck the blood of cattle, goats, and other livestock, and are often seen in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico.")
